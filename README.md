# python-mastermind

a simple python cli game

When the game starts, the code will generate a random number.

	Then it is your job to guess four-digit numbers.
	After each round, you will get hints based on how close your guess it.
	If you fail to guess the number after ten rounds, you lose.
	
This is a very simple script, for me to practice and learn about Python.

Hope you enjoy it!
